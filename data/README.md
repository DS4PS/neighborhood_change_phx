# Project Data

Here is the documentation for the data folder.

This project uses two primary sources for data: the Census API for 2015 data and select 2010 data, and the NHGIS time series data tables for 1990, 2000, and select 2010 data.

The Census API data was downloaded in February and March 2019 through the Census API package in R.

The NHGIS time series data tables were downloaded in April 2019 through https://www.nhgis.org/

All of the data is available in this folder- including raw data files that were not used for this project.
