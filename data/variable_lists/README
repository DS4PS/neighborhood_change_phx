This sub-folder contains all of the variable lists for NHGIS and ACS data from 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2015. 
For all of 2015 and some of 2010 data used in this project, the Metadata from the ACS 5 was used. 
Due to the size of this Metadata file, specific variable sub-groups were copied and pasted into separate csv files.
This folder contains all of those csv files, and can be used to read in all ACS variables for this project.

Additionally, these sub-files can assist anyone doing a project with ACS 5 data from 2015 interested in these same key variables.
